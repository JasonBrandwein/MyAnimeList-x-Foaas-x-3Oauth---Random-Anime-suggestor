# MyAnimeList x Foaas x 3Oauth - Random Anime suggestor
 This was a project to synchronously use Nodejs to do a 3 legged Oauth handshake. Then use myanimelist to randomly suggest an anime. Then to use the name of the suggested anime to give a funny random synopsis of the anime using the FOAAS api services.
